I’m a Pacificnorthwesternese(A Chinese lives in the PNW btw), which pretty much determines that I love mountains and the wilderness. Sometimes I think about when Skynet controls the world, I’d be living in a cabin in a remote mountain area hacking the Skynet to save civilization and hunting deer for food.

Imagination aside, I’m a programmer and hacker by nature. When I was a child a lot of kids have electronic dictionaries(right, we had those instead of Gameboys), but little did my parents knew that I actually had games on those stupid study machines. We played a text-based Pokemon game that was written in a BASIC-like language. Out of frustration of being suck at playing games(I still am) I went into the source code and start changing all of the parameters like the probability of critical hits, damage per hit, level and everything. So all my Pokemons were incredibly strong, then I started to distribute this “hacked” version of the game. As a result, we got bored and stopped playing the game altogether. Fast forward, I’m in love with programming and building software, and I’m determined to be doing this for the rest of my life.
