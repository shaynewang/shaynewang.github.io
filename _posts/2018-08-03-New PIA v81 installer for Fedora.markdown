Here is the [Download](https://storage.googleapis.com/installers-pia-unofficial/pia-v81-installer-fedora.tar.gz) link
for an unofficial private internet access VPN installer for Fedora.

With [@edouardmenayde](https://github.com/edouardmenayde) help from
[here](https://github.com/edouardmenayde/pia-fedora). I was able to modify
the [official PIA installer](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/installer/download_installer_linux) for v81
to work with Fedora(Fedora 27 Workstation tested).
